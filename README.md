## Running the FAANG Stock Data Downloader

The main script for downloading and plotting FAANG stock data is `faang.py`.

### To run the script from the command line:

```powershell
python faang.py
```

This will:
- Download the latest hourly data for the previous five days for the FAANG stocks (META, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG)
- Save the data as a CSV file in the `data/` directory
- Generate a plot of the closing prices and save it as a PNG in the `data/` directory

You can modify the script to accept command-line arguments for custom date ranges or output locations if needed.

## Appendix

### Setting up a Python Environment

1. **Create a virtual environment** (using Python 3.13 or your installed version):

	```powershell
	python -m venv venv
	```

2. **Activate the environment**:

	```powershell
	.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
	```

3. **Install required packages** (if you have a `requirements.txt` file):

	```powershell
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

4. **Deactivate the environment** when done:

	```powershell
	deactivate
	```
